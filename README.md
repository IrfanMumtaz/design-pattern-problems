# 🎯 Design Patterns & SOLID Principles Challenge Repository

## 📖 Overview
This repository is a **learning playground** for developers to practice solving real-world software problems using **Design Patterns** and **SOLID Principles**.  

Instead of just reading theory, you will tackle **practical coding challenges** that simulate real engineering problems. Each challenge requires you to:
- Implement a solution in **any programming language**.  
- Apply **appropriate design patterns**.  
- Follow **SOLID principles**.  
- Explain **why you chose your approach**, including trade-offs and alternatives.  

The goal is not only to write working code but to **think like a software architect**.

## 🎯 Why This Repository Exists
Modern software development is not just about “making it work” — it’s about building **scalable, maintainable, and extensible** systems.  

This repo exists to help developers:
1. **Understand when and why** to use design patterns (not just how).  
2. **Practice SOLID principles** in real scenarios.  
3. **Learn trade-offs** of different design decisions.  
4. **Improve communication skills** by explaining solutions clearly.  
5. **Think beyond syntax** and develop **architectural thinking**.  

---

## 🛠 How It Works
- Each problem is defined in a structured format with:
  - **Problem Statement**  
  - **Requirements**  
  - **Deliverables**  
  - **Evaluation Criteria**  

- Developers solve the problem using **any language**.  
- Developers submit:
  - Their **code implementation**.  
  - A **short write-up** explaining:
    - The **design pattern(s)** used.  
    - How **SOLID principles** were applied.  
    - **Trade-offs** in the chosen solution.  
    - Possible **alternative approaches**.

## 📦 What You Will Learn
By completing these challenges, you will:  
- ✅ Get hands-on practice with **GoF design patterns** (Factory, Strategy, Observer, etc.).  
- ✅ Apply **SOLID principles** to make code cleaner and extensible.  
- ✅ Learn to **reason about design trade-offs**.  
- ✅ Build the habit of **writing maintainable, future-proof code**.  
- ✅ Improve your ability to **explain technical choices** (a key interview and leadership skill).  

---

## 📚 Example Challenge Topics
- Email service management (Strategy / Factory + SRP).  
- Payment gateway integration (Open/Closed + Strategy).  
- Notification system (Observer pattern).  
- Report generation with multiple formats (Factory + OCP).  
- Logger system with multiple outputs (Decorator / Strategy).  
- Plugin-based architecture (Dependency Inversion + Factory).  

Each challenge is mapped to one or more **design patterns** and **SOLID principles** so you get structured learning.  

---

## ✅ Who Is This For?
- **Junior Developers** → Learn clean design early.  
- **Mid-Level Developers** → Strengthen architecture & pattern usage.  
- **Senior Engineers / Leads** → Sharpen explanation and trade-off reasoning.  
- **Interview Preparation** → Many interview questions ask about design & SOLID.  

---

## 🚀 Advantages of Doing These Exercises
- Think beyond coding → **design & architecture mindset**.  
- Reduce “spaghetti code” by following **SOLID & patterns**.  
- Become more confident in **interviews and technical discussions**.  
- Sharpen your ability to **justify design decisions** (trade-offs).  
- Build a **portfolio of design-focused problems** you can showcase.  

---

## 🏗 Repo Structure

- **problems.md/** → Contains all defined challenges.  
- **solutions/** → Developers submit their solutions and explanations.  
- **README.md** → You are here.  

---

## 🤝 How to Contribute
1. Pick any problem. `problem is defined in md file`  
2. Solve it in your preferred programming language.  
3. Add your solution to `/solutions/<your-name-or-team>/problem_name`.  
4. Include a **README or notes** explaining your thought process.  

---

## 🎓 Final Note
This repository is about **learning by doing**.  
You may not always pick the "perfect" design pattern — and that’s fine! The goal is to **practice reasoning**, **understand trade-offs**, and **grow as a software designer**.  

> 💡 *“Code is read more often than it is written. Design patterns and SOLID help us write code that future developers (including you) can read and extend with ease.”*
